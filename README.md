# jlib

jlib is my personal c library of type independent data structures. **This should
not be used in other projects, this library is for my experimentation and is a
learning experience. This may not work 100% right all the time, and bugs may be
present.** I based my designs loosly on
[klib](https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib/tree/master), which means
everything is implemented in macros that allow the user to set the type when
they call the init function.

Current Data Structures:
- Doubly Linked List (dllist.h)

Future Data Structures:
- Hashmap
- Heap
- Stack
- Tree
- Graph?
